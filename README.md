# Titanic Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a simple data analysis project on the famous Titanic dataset. 
The goal of this project is to explore and visualize the relationship between passenger demographics (specifically sex and age) and their survival rate.

## Project Overview

The analysis was performed using Python, with the following key libraries:
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.

## Files

* `train (1).csv`: The original dataset used for the analysis.
* `titanic_analysis.ipynb` or `titanic_analysis.py`: This is where your Python code would be. It includes the steps for data cleaning, manipulation, and plotting.
* `survival_by_sex.png`: A bar chart visualizing the number of survivors based on their sex.
* `age_distribution.png`: A histogram showing the age distribution of passengers who survived versus those who did not.
* `cleaned_titanic_data.csv`: The cleaned version of the dataset, containing only the 'PassengerId', 'Survived', 'Sex', and 'Age' columns.
